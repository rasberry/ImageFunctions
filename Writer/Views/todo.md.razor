# TODO #

## General ##
* need to test -# option for all processors
* refactor wiki generator to use msbuild task instead of tests
  * BuildWikiTask fails for imagemagick
  * ```dotnet msbuild /t:BuildWiki test\test.csproj /p:RebuildImages=true```
* maybe color the 'usage' text a little ?
* maybe add syntax to chain image functions together
  * possibly using '--' to separate actions
  * need to figure out input/output file(s)
  * is there a need for multiple-in / multiple-out ?
* samplers seem to have a n off-by-one issue (see dotnet run -- areasmoother salieri-bx.png -t 2 --max-threads 1 --sampler 2)
* use ```private static readonly ImageComparer ValidatorComparer = ImageComparer.TolerantPercentage(0.05f);``` instead of custom comparer for image tests
* add a Point type TryParse - several functions use 'x y' and could use 'x,y' instead - also would be good to consolidate this code

## Ideas ##
* add noise functions
  * perlin
  * opensimplex - https://gist.github.com/digitalshadow/134a3a02b67cecd72181
  * simplex ?
  * maybe add random points and then draw gradients between closest ones (use trie?)
    * might be able to do this little by little
      1. random points in an area
      1. add gradients
      1. save border points for next area
      1. repeat
* distance map
  * maybe do a tree ring expanding from random center points
    * for each pixel
    * find nearest starting point (trie?) - dotnet add package KdTree
    * calculate distance to point
    * color pixel based on distance
  * create distance map - foreach pixel - find nearest prime by spiraling from coordinate; calc distance; draw color based on distance
    * probably should use kd-tree or trie to find closest neighbor
    * have pre-defined point layouts
      * ulam spiral primes
      * random
      * evenly spaced grid
      * any number sequence from https://oeis.org/ - plot in a spiral ?
    * allow csv, or external points list to be passed in
* take a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_(mathematics)
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurer_rose
* spiral graphs
  * remove/keep prime number spots
  * make rotation distance configurable (best one is golden ratio)
* fermats last theorem graph
  * plot result of x^2 + y^2 distance from whole number
  * add option to change exponent (2 is the only one that has answers to x^2+y^2=z^2)
  * add option to change starting point
* Implement blind deconvolution
  * https://github.com/tianyishan/Blind_Deconvolution
* Implement seam carving
  * add option to start at the global minima instead of just the top/left row
  * add option to find minima per row instead of just the next neighbor pixels
  * add option to save what was removed in another file. (image splitting ..!)
  *
* Add code documentation
  * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/documentation-comments

## AllColors ##
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_RGB_color_space

## AreaSmoother ##
* create an areasmoother that samples surrounding pixels then weighted-averages them based on distance - similar to original but without picking the 'best' vector
* AS2 has an off-by-one error when using --rect option

## PixelateDetails ##
* Parallelize and add progress bar
* add a mode where borders inside of boxes are added
  * border color options [average, original, user specified color]
  * fill options [average, original, user specified color]
  * maybe include option to specify which boders to render ? (nesw) or (trbl)

## Derivatives ##
* Parallelize and add progress bar
* maybe add other types of derivatives

## ZoomBlur ##
* add a vertical / horizontal only zoom blur (curtain blur ?)

## Swirl ##
* is it possible to do a outer swirl (outside of radius towards edge instead of inwards?)

## Encryption ##
* add option to change key size? supposedly options are (128,192,256)

## Deform ##
* maybe implement [fisheye](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2477774/correcting-fisheye-distortion-programmatically)

## AllColors ##
* add arrangements
  * left to right / right to left
  * spiral in to out
* add option to invert sort order

## SpearGraphic ##
* breakout Third and Fourth into their own generators
* add a way to change the default control variable values
* add support for rectangle option '-#'

## ColatzVis ##
* not really working well.. need a new visualization

## UlamSpiral ##
* add support for color pallette
  * see https://github.com/rasberry/DensityBrot/blob/master/ColorMap.cs
  * option for starting at a different prime
  * option for coloring multiples
  * option for switching direction (ccw vs cw)

## Maze ##
* add maze types listed in http://www.jamisbuck.org/presentations/rubyconf2011/index.html
  * and https://github.com/armin-reichert/mazes
* Automata:
  * make max iterations variable (or do we need this ?) - maybe make % done related to number of changes per iteration
  * add options for initial random start
    * input image
    * random bits in an NxN square - maybe centered ? or possibly randomized center point
* add coloring based on age of cell (when cell was added to spanning tree)
  * use https://github.com/rasberry/DensityBrot/blob/master/ColorMap.cs
  * maybe create a variant that doesn't draw walls at all ? - color change will allow you to see the maze
* add coloring based on distance to solution cell
  * allow user to pick solution cell (cell x,y) default to (0,0)
  * you can use a solver that keeps track of unvisited cells to remove duplicate effort. (using a stack)
* add coloring based on average distance to all other cells
  * find the distance for all cells to (0,0)
  * then calculate the average difference between your cell distance and all of the others (absolute value difference)
  * that way you don't have to do an n^2 solution finding

## ProbableImg ##
* maybe add spiral traversal
* maybe go through original image pixel-by-pixel and run the random color updater
* possibly use huge structures to store profile ?
* maybe use tiles instead of pixels ?
* maybe research flood fill so i don't use random stack ?
* see about replicating https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse
  * and https://www.gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/

## Turmites ##
* add colors (processor.cs line 97)
  * should be able to use state\[x,y\] value % number of colors
* implement rule.count
* implement -img
  * need to convert colors to a count
